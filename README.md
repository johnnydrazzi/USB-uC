![Alt text](Images/USB_uC_27J53_2.jpg?raw=true "USB_uC_27J53")    
A bootloader for PIC microcontrollers, that makes your USB capable PIC appear to your computer as a thumb drive. Programming can be done through MPLABX or by simply dragging and dropping your Intel hex file onto the drive. No programmer, drivers or software to install.

The USB stack has been compliance tested using USB-IF's USB 3 Command Verifier (USB3CV) tool. Â 

**Features:**
- Bootloaders made for popular development boards.
- Different crystal options, including NO_XTAL.
- Drag and drop programming or through MPLABX.
- Read user flash as a PROG_MEM.BIN file.
- Erase user flash by deleting PROG_MEM.BIN.
- Read and write to EEPROM through a EEPROM.BIN file.
- Erase EEPROM by deleting EEPROM.BIN.
